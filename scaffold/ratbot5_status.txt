ratbot5 Diagnosis:

What works:
- Rats stay active entire game (no freeze)
- Attacks land (39 in 101 rounds)
- Pickups happen (13 cheese collected)

What doesn't work:
- Deliveries fail (only 7 transfers)
- Collectors stuck at dist 17-20 from king
- Can't navigate final approach to king
- King starves (HP 500 → 32)

Root cause: Movement system can't close final distance
Fix needed: Improve navigation to reach king (dist <= 9)
