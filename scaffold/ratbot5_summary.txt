What works:
- Attacks working (17 hits)
- Movement working (no freeze, 0 cooldown)
- Deliveries working (collectors finding some cheese)

What doesn't work:
- Only 1 collector finding cheese consistently
- Other 5-6 collectors finding 0 cheese
- They're exploring but not finding
- Need better exploration or cheese mine tracking

Next: Add cheese mine tracking from squeaks or improve exploration pattern
