Issue: Collector #13415 stuck at dist=29 for 50+ rounds

Evidence:
- Round 30-80: dist=29 (not changing)
- No MOVE_SKIP logs (not cooldown issue)
- No MOVE_TO logs (moveTo not logging entry)
- moveTo IS being called (line 566 in deliver)

Conclusion: moveTo is executing but silently failing
- Not returning early due to cooldown
- Executing but not producing movement
- Bug2 not helping

Next: Add logging inside moveTo to see execution path
