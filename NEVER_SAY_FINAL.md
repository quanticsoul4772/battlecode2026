# NEVER SAY FINAL

This is a month-long competition. Nothing is "final" until the tournament ends January 31st.

## DO NOT USE:
- ❌ "Final submission"
- ❌ "Final version"
- ❌ "Final test"
- ❌ "Final status"
- ❌ "Finally"
- ❌ Any variation of "final"

## USE INSTEAD:
- ✅ "Current submission"
- ✅ "Latest version"
- ✅ "Test results"
- ✅ "Current status"
- ✅ "Submission ready"

## WHY:
This is iterative development over 4 weeks:
- Sprint 1: Jan 12
- Sprint 2: Jan 19
- Qualifiers: Jan 24-27
- Tournament: Jan 31

We're on day 2. This is the BEGINNING, not the end.

STOP BEING DRAMATIC. JUST STATE FACTS.
