# ratbot2 - Ready for Scrimmage

**Date**: January 6, 2026, 9:51 PM
**Version**: ratbot2 with 5 economy rats + 9 traps

## Strategy

**Core Approach:**
- Spawn exactly 5 economy rats (all cheese collectors)
- Place 9 cat traps (900 damage)
- Flee from cats (avoid aggro)
- King survives on collection income

## Test Results

**vs ratbot (heavy spawning):**
- ratbot2 wins round 286 (opponent starves)

**vs ratbot2 (mirror match):**
- Survives 1,078 rounds
- 100 cheese deliveries
- Winner by delivery efficiency

**vs 0 spawns (pure king):**
- 5 rats strategy delivers 100 cheese
- Extends survival from 850 to 1,078 rounds

## Submission File

**Location**: `scaffold/submission.zip`
**Team**: ratbot2
**Package**: All rats are economy role

## Upload Instructions

1. Go to https://play.battlecode.org/
2. Navigate to your team submissions
3. Upload `scaffold/submission.zip`
4. Queue scrimmage against opponents

## Expected Performance

**Strengths:**
- Won't die from spawn-induced starvation
- 9 traps provide passive cat damage
- Minimal congestion (5 rats can navigate)
- Sustainable economy (100+ deliveries)

**Weaknesses:**
- Low cat damage (traps only = 900 damage)
- Vulnerable to aggressive opponents with better economy
- No active cat combat (pure defense)
- 20% cooperation score max from cheese transfers

## Next Iteration (After Scrimmage Results)

Based on opponent strategies, may need to:
- Add more rats if economy allows
- Implement cat distraction if cats ignore traps
- Adjust trap positions based on cat waypoint patterns
- Balance spawning vs collection based on results

**Ready to test in competition.**
